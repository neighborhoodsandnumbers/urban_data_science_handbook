# Complex Systems Textbook — Working Reference

## Book Identity
- **Title**: Complex Systems
- **Author**: A.C. Shannon-Ding
- **Format**: Jupyter Book (dark Tufte CSS theme, ET Book fonts)
- **Audience**: Graduate students and researchers
- **Scope**: ~700–800 pages, two-semester sequence
  - Semester 1: Parts I–IV (foundations, dynamical systems, networks/spatial, stat mech/scaling)
  - Semester 2: Parts V–VII (adaptive/evolutionary, inference/methodology, case studies)

## Structure
- 7 parts, 26 chapters, 4 appendices
- 149 sections, 21 computational labs
- Each chapter: analytical exposition + worked examples + computational lab
- Python is the medium of exploration, not an afterthought

## Key Design Decisions
- Part VI (Inference and Methodology) sits alongside theory, not in a separate stats course — inference *is* complex systems science
- Part VII case studies are capstone, not decoration — students learn to combine formalisms on messy real systems
- Labs are `.ipynb` files; expository sections are `.md`

## Style Guide

### Voice & Register
- **Conversational, first-person.** Direct address ("we will see that..."), accessible like Strogatz's *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos*.
- **Clearly smart, occasionally hip.** Cultural references to literature (Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky, Camus), music (Coltrane, Beatles, Bob Dylan) woven in naturally — the author has a life beyond the equations. These should feel earned, not forced.
- NOT dry or impersonal. The narrator is present, has opinions, and talks to the reader like a sharp colleague.

### Intellectual Stance
- **Present both sides, take a position.** On controversies (SOC, scale-free networks, edge of chaos, etc.): lay out the debate fairly, then state where the evidence points. The author has a view and shares it.
- This is a textbook with a perspective, not a neutral survey.

### Mathematical Rigor
- **State theorems, sketch proofs.** Key results stated precisely with proof sketches or intuitive arguments; full proofs cited. Like Strogatz or Newman.
- Not theorem-proof-corollary formalism, but not hand-waving either. The reader should trust the math.

### Historical Context
- **Chapter openings only.** Each chapter opens with brief historical framing (who, when, why it mattered), then shifts to pure exposition.
- History is scene-setting, not the main act. Keep it to 1–3 paragraphs at the top.

### Code in Prose
- **Frequent inline snippets.** Short code blocks (5–15 lines) appear mid-exposition in `.md` files to ground ideas immediately ("here's what this looks like in NumPy").
- Labs (`.ipynb`) are the full computational experience; prose code is illustrative, not exhaustive.

### Notation
- **Global consistency.** One unified notation system across all 26 chapters; deviations from field conventions flagged explicitly.
- Appendix B is the master reference. Symbol collisions (β as inverse temperature vs. infection rate) are resolved by choosing one system and sticking with it.

### Citations
- **Curated essentials.** 5–15 refs per chapter: the original paper, the best review, and 2–3 key follow-ups.
- The bibliography should be a quality reading list, not an exhaustive literature dump.

### Worked Examples
- **Always both synthetic and real.** Each concept shown first on synthetic/toy data for clarity, then immediately on a real dataset (city populations, earthquake catalogs, contact networks) to show what changes.
- Messiness is pedagogically important — it's where intuition gets tested.

### General Principles
- Python is woven in as the medium of exploration, never an afterthought or appendix
- Code is not supplementary — the computational labs are where intuition is built
- Each chapter should feel self-contained enough to assign independently, but reward sequential reading
- The two-semester split (I–IV / V–VII) should feel natural, not arbitrary

## Progress Log
- **Session 1**: Created full book scaffold (all 7 parts, 26 chapters, 4 appendices, 21 labs). CSS/fonts copied from urban_data_science_handbook. Conducted style interview and established voice, rigor, notation, citation, and example conventions.
- **Session 2**: Wrote section 1.1 (Emergence, Self-Organization, and Adaptation) with chapter-opening historical vignette (Bénard 1900). Covers Anderson's "More Is Different", Goldstein's emergence hallmarks, weak/strong emergence (Chalmers/Bedau), self-organization ingredients (Camazine et al.), Deneubourg's double-bridge ant experiment, Grassé's stigmergy, Holland's CAS definition. Includes two inline code snippets (Game of Life, ant bridge model) and taxonomy table. Populated references.bib with 8 entries. Fact-checked: corrected "whale oil" to "spermaceti" per Bénard's actual experimental setup.
- **Session 3**: Wrote section 1.2 (Reductionism and Its Limits). Covers Descartes's method (1637), Anderson's reductionist vs constructionist distinction, three case studies of constructionist failure (three-body problem/Poincaré, protein folding/Levinthal paradox, phantom traffic jams/Nagel-Schreckenberg), Weinberg's grand vs petty reductionism as counterargument, Laplace's demon demolished three ways (QM, chaos, computational irreducibility). Inline code: Nagel-Schreckenberg traffic CA. Added 7 new bibliography entries. All facts verified.
- **Session 4**: Major structural work on the book scaffold and build pipeline.
  - Fixed CI build failure: added missing `repository.url` to `_config.yml` (required by `use_repository_button: true`).
  - Added `numbered: true` to all TOC parts (except Appendices) for consistent `X.Y.` section numbering in sidebar.
  - Created dedicated chapter intro files (`X_0_chapter_intro.md`) for all 26 chapters so sidebar shows proper chapter titles (e.g., "Mathematical Preliminaries" not "Linear Algebra Essentials").
  - Simplified ~80 verbose section titles across the book (e.g., "Simon's Near-Decomposability and the Architecture of Complexity" → "The Architecture of Complexity"). Preserved subtopic details as HTML comments for future writing.
  - Enabled notebook execution (`execute_notebooks: force`) and created `plot_config.py` with the handbook's dark Tufte matplotlib theme.
  - Fixed sidebar CSS: removed native `<summary>` disclosure triangle (kept chevron), scoped `▼`/`▶` pseudo-element selectors to `.bd-article` only, collapsed extra spacing on sidebar TOC items.
  - Wrote initial draft of section 2.1 (Linear Algebra Essentials).
  - **User feedback & learnings**:
    - User wants chapter titles to be *crisp* — avoid overloaded compound titles. Prefer "The Architecture of Complexity" over "Simon's Near-Decomposability and the Architecture of Complexity." Subtopics go in the body, not the title.
    - User cares about sidebar layout details: no native disclosure triangles, no `▼` characters, compact spacing between TOC items. The chevron icon should stay.
    - User wants notebooks pre-executed so charts render automatically in the built book.
    - Always update CLAUDE.md with progress AND feedback/learnings, not just a changelog.
    - Plan sections in detail before writing. Evaluate the plan. Take time to do a great job.
- **Session 5**: Revised section 2.1 (Linear Algebra Essentials) based on planning agent feedback — initial draft was too slim relative to sections 1.1/1.2.
  - Restructured to match plan: (1) Opening hook with "most overloaded data structure" framing, (2) "Matrices as Descriptions of Systems" — expanded from ~200 to ~450 words with adjacency/Jacobian/covariance triptych, (3) "Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors" — added conjugate pair theorem, sharpened spectral theorem statement, explicit trace-det quadratic formula, (4) "Spectral Decomposition and the Matrix Exponential" — new section combining matrix powers, Markov chains, Perron-Frobenius, and matrix exponential, (5) "Worked Example: The Graph Laplacian" — major expansion (~500 words) with barbell graph, Fiedler vector community detection, quadratic form interpretation, (6) "What We'll Need Later" — new closing with forward-reference table mapping concepts to chapters.
  - Removed: standalone SVD subsection (deferred to Part VI with brief mention in closing table), norms subsection (premature — introduce when needed), "Special Matrices" grab-bag section (positive definite folded into covariance discussion, stochastic matrices folded into Perron-Frobenius discussion).
  - Added Newman (2018) and Chung (1997) to references.bib for graph Laplacian citations. Total section refs: Strang, Chung, Newman (Trefethen removed from inline citation since section now focuses on conceptual rather than computational).
  - Three code blocks: (1) three matrix types with eigenvalues, (2) Jacobian classifier with damped pendulum, (3) barbell graph Laplacian with Fiedler vector.
  - **User feedback & learnings**:
    - **CRITICAL WORKFLOW**: When a planning agent is running, WAIT for it to complete before beginning to write. Do not start writing in parallel with planning. The plan's structure and depth targets should guide the writing, not be reconciled after the fact.
    - Section depth should match the baseline set by earlier sections (1.1, 1.2 are ~2300-2500 words). A math section being noticeably thinner than narrative sections signals inadequate coverage.
    - The plan agent's detailed subsection word counts, topic orderings, and "what this section is NOT" guidance are essential inputs — they prevent scope creep and ensure deliberate omissions.
